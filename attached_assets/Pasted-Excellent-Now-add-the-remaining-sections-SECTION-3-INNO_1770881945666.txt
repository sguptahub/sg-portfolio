SECTION HEADER:
"Exploring the Future of Development"
Subtext: "Experimenting with AI-native tools and vibe coding"

2-COLUMN LAYOUT:

LEFT COLUMN (60%):
HEADLINE: "Why Vibe Coding Matters for TPMs"

BODY TEXT:
"The future of program management includes rapid prototyping, building internal tools, and creating proof-of-concepts without waiting for engineering sprints.

Vibe coding—instructing AI agents to build applications through natural language—makes this possible. I'm exploring how TPMs can leverage these tools to:

✓ Build dashboards and tracking tools in hours, not weeks
✓ Create working prototypes for stakeholder alignment
✓ Automate repetitive workflows without coding knowledge
✓ Move from 'spec writer' to 'builder' mindset"

SECTION 4: MY APPROACH - The APEX-AI Framework
Back to dark background

SECTION HEADER:
HOW I LEAD AI/GENAI PROGRAMS

After shipping 5+ AI systems from pilot to production, I've developed a repeatable framework I call APEX-AI:

[Visual diagram: Govern → Assess → Map → Pilot → Measure → Scale]

This approach has delivered:
- $10M+ in cost savings (SaaS rationalization)
- 80% fraud reduction (ML-powered detection)
- 75% downtime reduction (IoT predictive maintenance)

THE FRAMEWORK IN ACTION:

3-COLUMN LAYOUT (equal width cards with icons):

COLUMN 1:
ICON: [Shield icon]
TITLE: GOVERN FIRST
DESCRIPTION:
Establish AI guardrails before deployment—bias detection, explainability, responsible AI practices

COLUMN 2:
ICON: [Target icon]
TITLE: ASSESS STRATEGIC FIT
DESCRIPTION:
Identify use cases with 10x impact potential, not 10% improvements

COLUMN 3:
ICON: [Map icon]
TITLE: MAP TO WORKFLOWS
DESCRIPTION:
Connect AI tools to actual work processes, not just "try Copilot"

COLUMN 4:
ICON: [Flask icon]
TITLE: PILOT WITH RIGOR
DESCRIPTION:
30-90 day experiments with clear success criteria and phased rollout (Shadow → Supervised → Autonomous)

COLUMN 5:
ICON: [Chart icon]
TITLE: MEASURE AT 3 LEVELS
DESCRIPTION:
Activity (30 days) → Project (90 days) → Organization (6-18 months)

COLUMN 6:
ICON: [Rocket icon]
TITLE: SCALE SYSTEMATICALLY
DESCRIPTION:
Standardize what works, build AI literacy, embed into processes

[PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOT]
Use a placeholder image from path /assets/sanjay-headshot.jpg. Style: Circular crop, 300px size, with a subtle 2px emerald glowing border. Alt text: 'Sanjay Gupta - Senior Technical Program Manager'.

RIGHT COLUMN (60%):
HEADLINE: "From Builder to Leader"

BODY:
"My journey: Developer → Solution Architect → Technical Program Manager.

This progression gave me something most TPMs don't have: deep technical credibility. I can architect solutions, speak engineering language, and translate complex AI systems into business outcomes.

At Applied Materials and RingCentral, I've led programs spanning AI/ML, cloud transformation, IoT, and enterprise platforms—consistently delivering measurable impact through clarity, execution discipline, and stakeholder alignment.

Outside tech, I apply the same endurance mindset to long-distance running as a Half-Marathon finisher. The parallels are real: pace yourself, focus on the next milestone, finish strong."
